            This is a Swift 6 wrapper around libVLC 4.0 for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and Mac Catalyst.

            Focus your review on:
            1. Swift 6 concurrency — verify @MainActor isolation, Sendable conformance, async/await patterns, and isolated deinit usage
            2. Memory management — libVLC objects use manual reference counting (libvlc_*_release), check for leaks and use-after-free
            3. API safety — typed throws (throws(VLCError)), proper error propagation, and safe C interop via UnsafePointer
            4. Thread safety — libVLC callbacks fire on internal threads, ensure AsyncStream.Continuation.yield is used correctly
            5. Cross-platform compatibility — verify code works on iOS 18+, macOS 15+, tvOS 18+, and Mac Catalyst
            6. Observable correctness — @Observable macro usage, access/withMutation tracking for SwiftUI integration
